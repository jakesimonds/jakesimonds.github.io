    <h1>The Give Up List</h1>
    <time>April 19, 2025</time>
    <p>2025 has felt a little bit like:</p>
<p><img src="/img/dunningKrugerJake.png" alt="&ldquo;How 2025 feels&rdquo;"></p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m struggling with these days is having anxiety about <em>what</em> to learn.</p>
<p>A small thing that&rsquo;s helped has been enthusiastically giving up the stuff that just isn&rsquo;t really serving me personally.</p>
<h1 id="the-give-up-list">The Give Up List</h1>
<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>
<p>Fuck vim for how it made me feel the first time I tried to use it and couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to get out of it and then thought <em>maybe a computers career isn&rsquo;t for me</em>. Also fuck vi, nvim and the other ones I haven&rsquo;t heard of. I&rsquo;m thankful that at least I was never down bad enough to convince myself I needed to learn Emacs.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need vim. I have enough syntax I&rsquo;m trying to keep in my pea-sized junior dev brain that I don&rsquo;t need to also remember how to navigate a goddamn file. I am a VSCode simp, and it is 2025, and if there&rsquo;s places VSCode can&rsquo;t take me maybe those places aren&rsquo;t for me.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m sshed into a server or whatever and I need to make some small fix I&rsquo;ll use nano. At least I can copy and paste and move the dang cursor.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-monitors">Multiple Monitors</h2>
<p>The <strong>Best Way To Do Things</strong> is with every app full screen (maybe certain apps can be half-screen and share) on different desktops, swapping back between them all with command+tab. So simple. So easy. Can&rsquo;t fuck it up.</p>
<p>I do use multiple monitors still. But now I have my Main Monitor, and then the second one is really just hanging out on deck, there for emotional support mostly.</p>
<p>Multiple Monitors is bullshit because you can&rsquo;t focus on two things at once. So by having multiple monitors you&rsquo;re lying to yourself in a dangerous way. And then with multiple monitors there&rsquo;s too many ways to have things so I can never find what I need, and then when I command+tab for it I don&rsquo;t know where or in what size it will show up.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-windows">Minimizing windows</h3>
<p>This is tangential to Multiple Monitors. But once you embrace the multiple-desktops and command+tabbing between apps you must never minimize a window ever again for the rest of your life. Because then you can&rsquo;t command+tab to it. So never minimize, always just either close it or move it to another desktop.</p>
<h2 id="daily-notes">Daily Notes</h2>
<p>I used to have a shell script that would make a fresh .md file in my obisidan vault with the date in its title. The script would also take yesterday&rsquo;s note and move it to a directory /Old-Notes, and I it was my morning work ritual to run it and it always made me feel oh-so-smart-and-clever.</p>
<p>On reflection, waste of my time.</p>
<p>A day is not enough time to warrent having its own note file.</p>
<p>Lately I just have one big note (<a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/)">https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/the-append-and-review-note/)</a>. It&rsquo;s so easy.</p>
