    <p><em>&hellip;because talking to computers is just totally bananas</em></p>
<h1 id="i-talk-to-computers-more-than-i-talk-to-people">I talk to computers more than I talk to people</h1>
<p>If you count &rsquo;talking&rsquo; as an exchange of any sort of message, I definitely talk to computers more than people. If you randomly take &lsquo;something I&rsquo;m writing or saying&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a greater than 50% chance it&rsquo;s not meant for a human.</p>
<p>This blog post is probably going to get &lsquo;processed&rsquo; by LLMs more times than its read by human eyeballs.</p>
<p>And while today words literally coming out of my mouth are probably 80-90% human-bound, I really like google gemini assistant and that ratio is probably trending towards and beyond 50% too.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think is is TERRIBLE per-se, but it&rsquo;s been this way for a while and I only recently kinda thought of it this way.</p>
<h1 id="the-1-person-1-billion-dollar-companywhat-a-sad-sad-dream">The 1-person-1-billion-dollar-company&hellip;what a sad, sad dream</h1>
<p>First time I heard someone mention this it was in-person, at the github offices in San Francisco from a speaker giving a talk and I thought, &lsquo;Wow.  This pathetic/sad man is being surprisingly transparent about his pathetic/selfish dreams for this incredible technology.&rsquo; And then I <em>kept</em> hearing about the 1-person-1-billion-dollar idea, with the same unapologetic glee, and it just bums me out.</p>
<p>I think I get what people (charitably) mean when they talk about the one-person-1-billion-dollar company: one person can do a lot more with LLMs. That&rsquo;s cool.</p>
<p>But just to come right out and say phrase it as &lsquo;one person can make a BILLION dollars with NO HELP how COOL IS THAT?!&rsquo;  and to focus so much on the not sharing aspect of it&hellip;its a bummer and makes me feel like silicon valley culture really is juvenile and gross.</p>
<h1 id="its-crazy-that-vibe-coding-works-at-all-considering-90-of-the-toolstechnologies-we-use-are-pre-ai">its crazy that vibe coding works at all considering 90+% of the tools/technologies we use are pre-AI</h1>
<p>A blog post I read &amp; liked recently (<a href="https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/">https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/</a>) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m confident the designers of the Go programming language didn’t set out to produce the most LLM-legible language in the industry. They succeeded nonetheless.</p></blockquote>
<p>This resonated, and has had me reflecting recently on some of my own experiences vibing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done weird things that at the time I didn&rsquo;t realize were weird&hellip;like set up an EC2 as a web server with nginx without once looking at the nginx docs (And only even using nginx because a chatbot told me to). I look at docs more these days, but learning to code, I really truly never did.</p>
<p>ChatGPT dropped ~1 year into my &lsquo;getting into tech.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m realizing more and more that my experiences learning (&amp; learning to love) computer stuff will very soon be unremarkable and incredibly normal, but today make me a very different species of developer than the people I work with.</p>
<p>I feel like a guy in a T-rex costume standing around at a party where everyone else is dressed normally and it&rsquo;s 8:45, and around 9 is when the rest of the people in the dinosaur costumes are expected to show up.</p>
<p>I feel bet-my-life confident that very soon my experiences will be very normal, but right now I&rsquo;m a weirdo. And I&rsquo;m equally confident that in this coming world where I&rsquo;m normal, the world is gonna be a much stranger place.</p>
<p>Hold on to your butts!</p>
