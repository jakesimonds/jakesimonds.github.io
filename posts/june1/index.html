    <time>June 1, 2025</time>
    <p>(This is literally a week of journal entries, which I fed to an LLM and told to transform/translate into something without specifics that I could post on my blog as a personal update. Then a half-dozen or so iterations of telling it to not include things, or changes in tone, then finally I literally edited a few places, and that&rsquo;s it.)</p>
<h1 id="how-is-jake-doing">How Is Jake Doing?</h1>
<p><em>A periodic check-in experiment</em></p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s doing well overall - navigating the usual mix of professional growth and personal projects that keeps things interesting.</p>
<h2 id="work-life">Work Life</h2>
<p>Work&rsquo;s been engaging lately with some new technical territory to explore. The learning curve keeps things challenging in a good way, and there&rsquo;s satisfaction in tackling problems that would have seemed impossible not too long ago. Still plenty of room to grow, but that&rsquo;s part of what makes it interesting.</p>
<h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal Stuff</h2>
<p>He&rsquo;s been having FOMO seeing the creative projects of old friends on social media&ndash;excited to see people having success, but also with that feeling sad/nostalgic for a time when he felt more plugged into the creative world.</p>
<p>Making progress on some personal habits and routines - nothing dramatic, but the kind of steady improvements that actually stick. Currently working through <em>The Power Broker</em>, getting back into regular exercise that&rsquo;s more sustainable than previous attempts, and learning drums which has been surprisingly enjoyable.</p>
<h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h2>
<p>Beyond work, he&rsquo;s been tinkering with some side interests and thinking about ways to be more intentional about social connections. Always a few ideas percolating about creative projects or ways to engage with the broader tech community.</p>
<h2 id="the-vibe-check">The Vibe Check</h2>
<p>Things feel pretty dynamic right now - lots of different threads to pull on both professionally and personally. There&rsquo;s a good energy around learning new things and making connections, with that satisfying sense of building momentum on various fronts.</p>
<p>Generally in a phase of saying yes to interesting opportunities and seeing where they lead.</p>
<p><em>Next update when there&rsquo;s news to share.</em></p>
