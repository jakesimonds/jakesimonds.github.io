&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://latenthomer.com">http://latenthomer.com&lt;/a> is a very simple semantic search web app I built to teach myself about embeddings. The way it works is, I generated embeddings for one-sentence descriptions of 70 Simpsons characters and am storing them in a ChromaDB instance. You can go to the site, describe a person ((or type or person, i.e. &amp;lsquo;&lt;em>bad houseguest&lt;/em>&amp;rsquo;, &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;classic personality hire&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em>, &lt;em>&amp;lsquo;silly elderly man&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em>&amp;hellip;) or literally just input any string at all) and it&amp;rsquo;ll generate an embedding for your string, and then query my collection of character descriptions for matches based on cosine similarity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dash Robot with Llama</title><link>localhost:1313posts/robotwllama/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 16:09:52 -0400</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/robotwllama/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Watching the short demo video (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FoStVCW7-HY?si=YCHYhMVfsc7IoSCu">https://youtu.be/FoStVCW7-HY?si=YCHYhMVfsc7IoSCu&lt;/a>) is probably the best quick way to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but to teach myself web development I made kinda the classic Web Development basic non-trivial website (with (super basic) authentication, a database, a front-end, a backend&amp;hellip;) but made it so you could log in, connect (locally) to a toy robot over bluetooth, and then drive it around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You &amp;lsquo;drive it around&amp;rsquo; by just passing basic API calls (forward, left, right, back) to another program that passes those commands along to the robot itself. Initially I had plans to make the whole thing more feature-ful, since the toy robot &amp;amp; the API I found for it had a lot of diverse functionality. But it was tedious making buttons (&amp;amp; then deciding where the buttons should go, etc), so I only did a little bit. I tentatively thought about exposing more methods via a documented API, as maybe a teaching tool for students, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t do that either just out of laziness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Thoughts on XZ Backdoor Exploits</title><link>localhost:1313posts/xzbackdoor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:54:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/xzbackdoor/</guid><description>&lt;p>April Fools!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer &amp;lt; 1 year into my career. I use ChatGPT a lot, sometimes maybe too much or beyond its purposes (working at the edge of your abilities &amp;gt; working at the edge of ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s abilities).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Say I&amp;rsquo;m reading a blogpost I found on hacker news and a paragraph or sentence mentions two or three acronyms I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of. ctrl + c / ctrl + v -&amp;gt; ChatGPT! Since the context is already embedded in whatever I&amp;rsquo;m giving it, my anecdotal experience is that it does pretty decently defining terms (and I avoid the annoying thing of googling some obscure acronym and getting back some Realtor&amp;rsquo;s Association in Nevada that shares the acronym I&amp;rsquo;m hunting for).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 Delights and Not So Delightfuls</title><link>localhost:1313posts/2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2023 18:51:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/2023/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="things-i-found-delightful--not-so-delightful--in-2023">Things I found Delightful &amp;amp; Not-So-Delightful in 2023&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Year #2 of &amp;lsquo;getting into tech.&amp;rsquo; Feeling reflective, wanted to jot down some things that have brought me joy as well as a few things that just frustrated the hell out of me this year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Oh boy is linux fun! Bought a chromebook with ubuntu off a friend, and it has slowly become my primary personal machine. Trackpad sucks, bluetooth headphones sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t connect great (delay or just terribly quality). Other than that, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty sweet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dumb Electronics</title><link>localhost:1313posts/electronics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 20:42:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/electronics/</guid><description>&lt;p>This summer started picking up electric oddities and toys at the goodwill. Had some fun taking them apart, learning a bit (though less than you might think) about electrics, and occasionally tried some weird stuff.

&lt;p>Did you know that the &amp;lsquo;Percentage&amp;rsquo; on your wordle stats is simply the number you&amp;rsquo;ve done successfully, over the total number of attempts rounded to the nearest integer? So 198/199 = 99.4975ish, rounds down to 99.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="localhost:1313/img/oneHundredWordle.png" alt="&amp;ldquo;100 percent&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While 199/200 = 99.5, rounds up to 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel obligated to add: chasing this curiousity I cheated many times, by opening up a new browser and then continuing to guess until I knew I had the right word. Those two instances of getting it on the first guess were real, though. &amp;lsquo;Earth&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Piano&amp;rsquo; (which are both semi-regular starting words, which I was delighted to have tried on the days that they were that day&amp;rsquo;s word).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github Annotated</title><link>localhost:1313posts/github-annotated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 12:21:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/github-annotated/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="github-annotated">Github Annotated&lt;/h2>

&lt;h3 id="1">1&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making a github account, but I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that I did. Summer of 2021 I made a lot of accounts with various services trying to see if this &amp;lsquo;get into tech&amp;rsquo; idea held any water. Requested the data from my sister&amp;rsquo;s netflix at one point. Filled out a form to make a twitter bot. Watched some TED talks. Read a lot of marketing materials from Boot Camps. Couldn&amp;rsquo;t always distinguish educational materials from technical documentation from marketing materials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I made this site</title><link>localhost:1313posts/how-i-made-it/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2023 12:21:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>localhost:1313posts/how-i-made-it/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-it-is">What it is&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Made with a framework called &amp;lsquo;Hugo,&amp;rsquo; and specifically using a theme called &amp;lsquo;paper.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard about it on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I">youtube video&lt;/a>. One of the comments, still there on the video as of 11/19/23, says: &amp;ldquo;Hugo is the back-end developer&amp;rsquo;s best friend for making front-ends.&amp;rdquo; That pretty much sold me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me longer than I thought it would to get what I have today, and even this is less functionality-wise than my original ambitions. I was and sort of still am a little mystified at the relationships between the framework, and the theme, and my configs, and the universe. What&amp;rsquo;s cool is right now I&amp;rsquo;m writing this document in an .md file. Big fan of .md files.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
