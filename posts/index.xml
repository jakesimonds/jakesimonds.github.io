&lt;p>The LLM has a few superpowers. The one to keep top-of-mind vibe coding is that an LLM can inhale text in a way I can&amp;rsquo;t even really appreciate or understand. So my job is to throw text at it. Docs. Error messages. My own rambling (using f5 on my macbook set up as hotkey for transcription).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Give Up List</title><link>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/give-up-list/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Apr 2025 09:16:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/give-up-list/</guid><description>&lt;p>2025 has felt a little bit like:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You &amp;lsquo;drive it around&amp;rsquo; by just passing basic API calls (forward, left, right, back) to another program that passes those commands along to the robot itself. Initially I had plans to make the whole thing more feature-ful, since the toy robot &amp;amp; the API I found for it had a lot of diverse functionality. But it was tedious making buttons (&amp;amp; then deciding where the buttons should go, etc), so I only did a little bit. I tentatively thought about exposing more methods via a documented API, as maybe a teaching tool for students, but then didn&amp;rsquo;t do that either just out of laziness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Thoughts on XZ Backdoor Exploits</title><link>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/xzbackdoor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2024 17:54:55 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/xzbackdoor/</guid><description>&lt;p>April Fools!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Did you know that the &amp;lsquo;Percentage&amp;rsquo; on your wordle stats is simply the number you&amp;rsquo;ve done successfully, over the total number of attempts rounded to the nearest integer? So 198/199 = 99.4975ish, rounds down to 99.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://jakesimonds.github.io/img/oneHundredWordle.png" alt="&amp;ldquo;100 percent&amp;rdquo;">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While 199/200 = 99.5, rounds up to 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel obligated to add: chasing this curiousity I cheated many times, by opening up a new browser and then continuing to guess until I knew I had the right word. Those two instances of getting it on the first guess were real, though. &amp;lsquo;Earth&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Piano&amp;rsquo; (which are both semi-regular starting words, which I was delighted to have tried on the days that they were that day&amp;rsquo;s word).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Github Annotated</title><link>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/github-annotated/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 12:21:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/github-annotated/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="github-annotated">Github Annotated&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making a github account, but I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that I did.

&lt;p>Made with a framework called &amp;lsquo;Hugo,&amp;rsquo; and specifically using a theme called &amp;lsquo;paper.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I heard about it on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I">youtube video&lt;/a>. One of the comments, still there on the video as of 11/19/23, says: &amp;ldquo;Hugo is the back-end developer&amp;rsquo;s best friend for making front-ends.&amp;rdquo; That pretty much sold me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took me longer than I thought it would to get what I have today, and even this is less functionality-wise than my original ambitions. I was and sort of still am a little mystified at the relationships between the framework, and the theme, and my configs, and the universe. What&amp;rsquo;s cool is right now I&amp;rsquo;m writing this document in an .md file. Big fan of .md files.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
