      <description>Github Annotated 1 I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making a github account, but I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that I did. Summer of 2021 I made a lot of accounts with various services trying to see if this &amp;lsquo;get into tech&amp;rsquo; idea held any water. Requested the data from my sister&amp;rsquo;s netflix at one point. Filled out a form to make a twitter bot. Watched some TED talks. Read a lot of marketing materials from Boot Camps.</description>

      <description>What it is Made with a framework called &amp;lsquo;Hugo,&amp;rsquo; and specifically using a theme called &amp;lsquo;paper.&amp;rsquo;
I heard about it on a youtube video. One of the comments, still there on the video as of 11/19/23, says: &amp;ldquo;Hugo is the back-end developer&amp;rsquo;s best friend for making front-ends.&amp;rdquo; That pretty much sold me.
It took me longer than I thought it would to get what I have today, and even this is less functionality-wise than my original ambitions.</description>
