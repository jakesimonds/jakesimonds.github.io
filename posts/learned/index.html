    <h1>Things I Learned In Computer School: Pt 1</h1>
    <time>March 23, 2025</time>
    <p>(this is an ongoing series when I think of it of things I learned getting a degree in computer science that are maybe relevant to regular people while I still have a memory of what it was like to be a regular person)</p>
<h2 id="its-very-easy-to-write-a-program-that-would-run-until-the-sun-explodes-10-lines">It&rsquo;s VERY easy to write a program that would run until the sun explodes (10 lines)</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>def fibonacci_sum(n):
    if n &lt;= 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return fibonacci_sum(n-1) + fibonacci_sum(n-2)

    result = fibonacci_sum(10**100)
    print(f&#34;Result: {result}&#34;)  
</code></pre><p>If you paste this code into a python file and run it your computer will get to work, and just never finish because the problem is basically impossible to solve. It&rsquo;s not that any one thing I&rsquo;m asking the computer to do is intractable. It&rsquo;s just the problem is too big.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the computer equivalent of stalling out a car with a manual transmission. Or burning a cake. Or putting an ikea chair together but getting some critical orientation wrong when connecting things. It&rsquo;s just &hellip; oops no good can&rsquo;t do that!</p>
<p>Before computer school I was vaguely aware of things like bitcoin using lots of energy, but I always imagined for things like that that were so expensive they must also involve giant codebases and years of human work.</p>
<p>Not necessarily!</p>
<p>(And as a side-note, I don&rsquo;t actually know what would happen if you ran this code on a laptop. What I was TRYING to do was write a simple program that would run &lsquo;forever&rsquo;. But actually I imagine if you ran this you&rsquo;d run out of memory at some point, or some limitation in python would crash things.)</p>
<h2 id="people-have-always-hated-computers-and-to-love-computers-is-to-have-a-lovehate-relationship-with-computers">People Have ALWAYS Hated Computers (And to Love Computers is to have a Love/Hate Relationship with Computers)</h2>
<p>A historical example: There was an Important Computer called the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">DEC PDP-11</a>. Those acronyms stand for:</p>
<p>Digital Equipment Corporation Programmed Data Processor.</p>
<p>No mention of &lsquo;computer&rsquo;. Why? Because even back then (maybe especially back then) &lsquo;computer&rsquo; was a dirty word that people associated with incredibly expensive, hard to work, frustrating machines. So if you wanted to sell computers, or get your boss to buy you a computer, it helped to not call it computer!</p>
<p>A personal example: My worst day at work, or in school, in terms of what it feels like qualitatively is really not that different from when I was a kid and I couldn&rsquo;t get a printer to connect. Or video editing in 2007.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m doing very different things. Much more sophisticated things (if I can pat myself on the back). And, per hour-of-challenging-work I think I&rsquo;m a lot more patient and even-keeled now as someone professionally decent with computers. But even so you make it up in volume. And frustration is frustrating.</p>
