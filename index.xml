      <description>hello hello will this work?
nobody knows! Submit      new Vue({ el: &#39;#app&#39;, data: { inputText: &#39;&#39;, result: {} }, computed: { formattedResult() { if (!this.result.length) return &#39;&#39;; try { console.log(&#39;Result array:&#39;, this.result); return this.result.map(item = `${item}
`).join(&#39;&#39;); } catch (e) { console.error(&#39;Error processing result:&#39;, e); return &#39;Invalid result format&#39;; } } }, methods: { async getText() { try { const response = await axios.post(&#39;https://54.145.73.101:8000/query&#39;, { text: this.</description>

      <description>What is it? Watching the short demo video (https://youtu.be/FoStVCW7-HY?si=YCHYhMVfsc7IoSCu) is probably the best quick way to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on, but to teach myself web development I made kinda the classic Web Development basic non-trivial website (with (super basic) authentication, a database, a front-end, a backend&amp;hellip;) but made it so you could log in, connect (locally) to a toy robot over bluetooth, and then drive it around.
You &amp;lsquo;drive it around&amp;rsquo; by just passing basic API calls (forward, left, right, back) to another program that passes those commands along to the robot itself.</description>

      <description>Who am I? I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer &amp;lt; 1 year into my career. I use ChatGPT a lot, sometimes maybe too much or beyond its purposes (working at the edge of your abilities &amp;gt; working at the edge of ChatGPT&amp;rsquo;s abilities).
Use-Cases I&amp;rsquo;m Not Ashamed Of Acronym hunting Say I&amp;rsquo;m reading a blogpost I found on hacker news and a paragraph or sentence mentions two or three acronyms I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of.</description>

      <description>Things I found Delightful &amp;amp; Not-So-Delightful in 2023 Year #2 of &amp;lsquo;getting into tech.&amp;rsquo; Feeling reflective, wanted to jot down some things that have brought me joy as well as a few things that just frustrated the hell out of me this year.
Delightful Linux Chromebook Oh boy is linux fun! Bought a chromebook with ubuntu off a friend, and it has slowly become my primary personal machine. Trackpad sucks, bluetooth headphones sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t connect great (delay or just terribly quality).</description>

      <description>This summer started picking up electric oddities and toys at the goodwill. Had some fun taking them apart, learning a bit (though less than you might think) about electrics, and occasionally tried some weird stuff. If you&amp;rsquo;re in Portland ME and want to borrow either the camera or the keyboards for projects or fun, or collaborate on other similar stuff, be in touch!
Camera The case.

      <title>Wordle Percentage Curiousity</title>
      <link>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/wordle/</link>

      <description>Did you know that the &amp;lsquo;Percentage&amp;rsquo; on your wordle stats is simply the number you&amp;rsquo;ve done successfully, over the total number of attempts rounded to the nearest integer? So 198/199 = 99.4975ish, rounds down to 99.
While 199/200 = 99.5, rounds up to 100.
I feel obligated to add: chasing this curiousity I cheated many times, by opening up a new browser and then continuing to guess until I knew I had the right word.</description>

      <description>Mostly just giving myself practice writing scripts, trying to automate straightforward &amp;amp; somewhat tedious tasks.
Was an opportunity to try a little bash (first time), also incorporated an API call to a weather service and another script that queries the local public library for when new books I&amp;rsquo;m interested in might drop (not sure how well that&amp;rsquo;ll work yet&amp;ndash;grabbed those upcoming book titles for testing purposes).
One kinda nice thing about journalling in a text document vs the cloud: a little harder (though still very possible) to get distracted since you&amp;rsquo;re not directly in the browser.</description>

      <description>Github Annotated 1 I don&amp;rsquo;t remember making a github account, but I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that I did. Summer of 2021 I made a lot of accounts with various services trying to see if this &amp;lsquo;get into tech&amp;rsquo; idea held any water. Requested the data from my sister&amp;rsquo;s netflix at one point. Filled out a form to make a twitter bot. Watched some TED talks. Read a lot of marketing materials from Boot Camps.</description>

      <description>About Portland, ME-based software person. Can juggle up to five objects. CS Masters student at Northeastern (Roux Institute).
You can find some tutorials I made exploring images, latent space &amp;amp; jpg compression on youtube. I&amp;rsquo;m on bluesky and mastodon and other socials too. If you have a social internet thing that doesn&amp;rsquo;t suck I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear about it!
Very open to conversation/collaboration, remotely or in person here in Portland, ME.</description>

      <title>How I made this site</title>
      <link>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/how-i-made-it/</link>

      <guid>https://jakesimonds.github.io/posts/how-i-made-it/</guid>
      <description>What it is Made with a framework called &amp;lsquo;Hugo,&amp;rsquo; and specifically using a theme called &amp;lsquo;paper.&amp;rsquo;
I heard about it on a youtube video. One of the comments, still there on the video as of 11/19/23, says: &amp;ldquo;Hugo is the back-end developer&amp;rsquo;s best friend for making front-ends.&amp;rdquo; That pretty much sold me.
It took me longer than I thought it would to get what I have today, and even this is less functionality-wise than my original ambitions.</description>
