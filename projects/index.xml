      <description>Mostly just giving myself practice writing scripts, trying to automate straightforward &amp;amp; somewhat tedious tasks.
Was an opportunity to try a little bash (first time), also incorporated an API call to a weather service and another script that queries the local public library for when new books I&amp;rsquo;m interested in might drop (not sure how well that&amp;rsquo;ll work yet&amp;ndash;grabbed those upcoming book titles for testing purposes).
One kinda nice thing about journalling in a text document vs the cloud: a little harder (though still very possible) to get distracted since you&amp;rsquo;re not directly in the browser.</description>
